      <p>
        Hello! My name is Daniel and I enjoy creating things for the internet.
        My interest in web development started back in 2016 when I decided to
        try learning about UIUX design and what made websites work at Ironhack
        Madrid.
        <br /> Jump forward to today, and I've had the privilege of completing a
        masters in front-end development at The Valley Madrid and designing a
        project for a start-up.
        <br /> I continue to learn new things and build accessible, inclusive
        products and digital experiences.
        <br /> Here are technologies I've had the pleasure of working with:
